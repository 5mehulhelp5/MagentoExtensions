This extension is a magento extension and this extension will provide a magento Backend utility to provide attribute description with editor.

so when you install this extension it will provide a functionality to add one more description field in magento attribute create from so you can write a description for that particular attribute and display that in fronted.

<b>
To get Description for any attribute in fronted you can use this code.
$attribute = $_product->getResource()->getAttribute('manufacturer');
echo $attribute->getDescription();
Here "manufacturer" is a attribute code so you can write your attribute code.
</b>

This extension is tested on magento 1.5 to 1.9 version and it's working fine in all those version but if you still found any problem on that please contact me.
